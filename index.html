                <p class="About-Me-Text">After many years in the IT industry as a network engineer, I have decided to try something different.  
                I have spent many hours troubleshooting, designing, and supporting IT infrastructure, but now I have 
                chosen a field where I can be creative as well as remaining very technical.</p>
                <p class="About-Me-Text">Growing up in Chicago in the 80's, I was like any other child at the that time. I was fascinated by
                video games like Atari, Nintendo, and Sega.  I also wondered what it would be like to be a part of
                the team that designs the games.  Now, at the peak of my career, I have decided to dive in and find out 
                what web design and development is all about </p>
